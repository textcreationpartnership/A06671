            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:20665:3"/> and martch, as my remembrance will giue me leaue.</p>
            <p>Firſt, wee had a quicke paſſage to <hi>Roterdam,</hi> from thence to <hi>Delfe,</hi> where wee were muſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for the King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and was billited there for three weekes, where we had our Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, our Hats, and Colours, with our Armes giuen to vs: from thence we Marcht vp the Riuer of <hi>Rhine</hi> to <hi>Rayſe,</hi> where we ſtayed vntill we heard from his Excellence; from thence we Marcht vp the <hi>Rhine,</hi> vntill wee came right againſt <hi>Weſell,</hi> where his Excellence lay with twenty thouſand Horſe and Foote, and mounted his Ordinance againſt <hi>Weſell,</hi> where wee lay in leaguer the moſt part of Iuly, vntill the Bridge was made ouer the <hi>Rhine:</hi> and the firſt of Auguſt we Marcht ouer the <hi>Rhine;</hi> his Excellencies Musketieres gaue vs three volleyes of ſhot at our departing: from thence we Marcht accompanied with <hi>Graue Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,</hi> and his troupes of Horſe, and when we came to our lodging, wee were entertayned by the Boores of the Countrey, with freſh Straw, Bread, and Beere, and what elſe wee could get, and ſo Marcht forwards, ſometimes twenty miles a day, ſometimes more, and ſometimes leſſe: but <hi>Spin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dola</hi> made account to cut vs off euery man of vs; &amp; becauſe we Marcht extraordinary, he reported the Diuell did leade vs; but I am ſure that God was our guide and defender, and ſo wee Marcht vntill wee came to a Towne called <hi>Benſum,</hi> where we were billited three dayes, where we had good
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:20665:3"/> Wine in aboundance, and good cheare with it. The Wine was commonly ſet on the Table in a Paile or ſome ſuch like veſſell, wherein wee filled our glaſſe, and dranke euery man his belly full. From this Towne wee Marcht towards <hi>Anne,</hi> where dwelleth <hi>Graue Henrickes</hi> ſiſter, who is Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of that place, and ſhe Royally came to vs in the Field, with other Gallants in their Caroches, guarded with Horſe and Foote, whom courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly greeted our Lords and Captaines, we ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Battalia manner, which when ſhe returned, wee Marcht to a little Dorpe neere adioyning, where wee had two Alarums that night, which cauſed moſt of vs to leaue our victuals behind vs: ſome their meate a boyling, and ſome roſting, which was a great griefe vnto vs being hungry the next day. Alſo it was the firſt time that wee had any Alarum, and ſo wee Marcht from that Dorpe towards <hi>Wormes,</hi> where wee Marcht ouer the Riuer, and ſo thorough <hi>Wormes</hi> to a Dorpe ſixe miles diſtant from that place, and ſo wee Marcht vp and downe vntill wee did meete with the Princes of the Vnion, who ioyned with our forces to meete <hi>Spindola,</hi> who lay then in a Towne called <hi>Vpnam,</hi> which was yeelded to him, and there he Entrencht his Forces, that by no meanes poſſible they could remoue him out; wherefore the Generall gaue command to draw our Forces into Field to giue him battaile, and ſo we Marcht vntill wee had ſight of his Forces, and wee Marcht about to get the winde of them, the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:20665:4"/> which we obtayned, and then our Generall gaue commaund to draw out part out of euery Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, to be of the Forlorne Hope, to giue the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, whereof my ſelfe was one of the number, and Doctor <hi>Burges</hi> our Miniſter did encourage vs to fight valiantly, and did aſſure vs wee ſhould finde our reward in heauen: whereupon we feaſted our ſelues with ſuch victuals as wee had, and threw away our Snap-ſackes, with all our Prouiſion, both linnen and woollen, becauſe it would be troubleſome to vs, and couragiouſly prouiding vs for the battaile, and vpon the ſuddaine wee heard the Enemies Drums beate a Martch, where wee diſcried them to Martch backe againe to our Lodgings the next morning, for wee remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Field all that night, the next day our Generall had notice giuen him, that the Enemie did martch towards the Citie of <hi>Wormes,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee gaue commaund the next night to martch without ſound of Drumme, or diſplay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Coulours, thinking to meete with him before he came to <hi>VVormes:</hi> but the Enemie had intelligence of our comming, wherefore they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned backe into their Trenches that night, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing extreame colde, that it killed many of our Souldiers, as namely Captaine <hi>Truſſell,</hi> my Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant, and diuers others, whom died when they came to Garriſon into <hi>Frankendale,</hi> which was a little befor Chriſtmas, for the Rayne and Snow began to fall, that wee were not able to lye any longer in the Fields: wherefore wee marcht into
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:20665:4"/> 
               <hi>Frankendale,</hi> where we haue duty enough put vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vs, for euery third night we watch at the Ports and Bulwarkes, ſtanding Sentinell on the walles with our Armes in our hands: we do make them to ſtand, be he friend or foe, and cry <hi>que vella?</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides Alarums, which often times falles out, ſome times two or three in a weeke: wee had Alarum on the Saterday night before Shroue-Sunday, where wee were drawne all on the walls, and on the next night following wee were drawne out of the Towne, expecting to meete with ſome of the Enemies Forces, but we did not; and marching neere vnto <hi>Wormes</hi> without ſound of Drumme or diſplaying our Coulours, they thought vs to be Enemies, wherefore they ſhot at vs, and hurt two of our Company, wherefore wee diſcried our ſelues, and Marcht backe againe: and now wee are certified that <hi>Lepoltus</hi> the Emperours brother is comming downe with twelue thouſand to ayde <hi>Marques Spindola</hi> againſt vs, and they haue repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to beſiege this Towne and <hi>Wormes</hi> both in one day, but before they winne them, it will coſt them hote liquor, for our Generall gaue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund to burne ſome Townes neere vnto vs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Enemie ſhall not Intrench his Forces neere vs, and the Boores that dwelt in them haue brought their Goods into our Towne, and they themſelues doe worke vpon our Walles without the Towne, and are making halfe Moones, Scon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Bulwarkes, Counterſcarfes, and Trenches. Wee haue had lately 12. Peeces of Ordinance
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:20665:5"/> from <hi>Wormes</hi> to plant vpon our Walles, beſides the Peeces that were planted before, which will encounter with them before they come at our Towne; and afterwards, our nimble Muskatieres will ſpeake three words at once to them: Wee haue in our Towne many Streetes, and in euery Streete one Well with two Buckets of very good water, alſo a good Riuer running thorough the Towne: and neuertheleſſe, wee haue Wine in the Towne as plentifull as water, which is ſolde vnder three pence the quart: alſo Bread and Beere as good and cheaper then in England, and ſo of Fleſh and other commodities. There was in our martch good Hogs ſolde for twelue pence a peece and vnder, alſo Pullets, Pidgions, and other fleſh very reaſonable. I thinke we ſhall not haue the like penny-worthes when wee come to England: but we hope well, and purpoſe to make a tryall of it, and now vnwilling to be too tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, I will abruptly conclude. So remembring my loue and commendations to all my good friends, I reſt: committing you to the protection of the Almighty, this 9. of March. 1621.</p>
